              My name is Fabian. I started doing some small
              design work as a teenager for a few famous
              youtubers back in the days. Someday i wanted
              to do something more challenging and learn
              something new. I was always interested in
              coding and how computers work, so I started
              coding some smaller plugins and mods for
              different video games. I somehow discovered
              React and TypeScript, and this was the
              beginning of me being a front-end developer. I
              started doing projects for fun but someday,
              friends and local companys got interested in
              my work.
